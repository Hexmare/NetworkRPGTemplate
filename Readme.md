This is a Networking template that I have built Using JMonkey Engine 3, Zay-ES and Spider Monkey

Major thanks to PSpeed , BigBawb, Toboi, ZZueg and Roah for all of your help.

This project is Heavily based on the MonkeyTrap project by PSpeed, (http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/forum/topic/monkey-trap/)

The overall goal of this project was to make a very simple multiplayer network game template that provides a RPG like interface with a very simple chat. 

Controls Right click to pan, WASD to move, space to jump.

Running the project - a. Start the server ( ServerMain.java )
                      b. Start the client ( Main.java )
                            b.1. Type in your username ( Default is a random string ) 
                            b.2. enter hostname where your server is running ( Default is 127.0.0.1 )
** NOTE ** 
This code is not optimized, and is probably loaded with things that could be done better. Be advised that this is my first step into multiplayer networking and entity systems. I am putting this up so that maybe it will help others get started on some of these more complex subjects. As things are corrected and updated this template should grow into a great resource.

Full writeup and layout of how everything works together.
